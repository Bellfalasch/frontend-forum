# End-of-year

Thank you for a year of Front-end Forum!

**Jan - June**: we tried once a week (summaries found on Builders website).  
**Aug - Dec**: we tried bi-weekly and half-an-hour later, and recorded sessions.

Hopefully I'll get a written "2023 recap" out before Christmas. And perhaps also a little poll on what you wish to see for next year.

As always, a joy having you all!

## Next FEF

Next FEF is in 2024 - **17th of January** ...
