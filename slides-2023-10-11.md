# <twemoji-building-construction/> Flex

Reminder that a new generation Grid-replacer, named **Flex**, is out.

Tried it? Feedback?

It is *experimental*, so if you use it:

* Be prepared for sudden breaking changes
* Try it in a limited/controlled way
* Give Builders feedback on it!

# <twemoji-chart-increasing-with-yen/> Tech-Debt

I see some nice progress on tech-debt around the house.

More teams have moved to Vite and Vitest. It looks like this helps a lot with removing old Webpack and upgrading React and Node at the same time, as well as solving issues that Jest have. Less config, fewer files, equals reduced hassle.

Many devs report the same thing: don't bother hacking Jest, just go for Vitest!

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> Note from Security

*Don't (or at least be super-careful) sync request-tools to cloud!*

Postman and Insomnia now auto-syncs (or requires login with sync) to cloud all your projects. Be aware of the risks when testing requests containing keys, tokens, passwords, etc.

At least Postman have options to disable this - **do it**!

## Native CSS nesting

Sass and Less-users came for variables and nesting, now soon both features are mature in modern browsers!

*Native CSS nesting is around the corner!*

Johan Lindkvist: Here you can help influence how CSS cascading will work with the new nesting featureÂ - https://webkit.org/blog/14571/css-nesting-and-the-cascade/
