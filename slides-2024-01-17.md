It's a fast formatter for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and JSON that scores 97% compatibility with Prettier, saving CI and developer time. It's also a linter! One tool to rule them all.
* Biome 1.5 is out (new logo and website too) - https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-v1-5/
* Wins the 25k USD bounty on "a faster Rust-based prettier" - https://biomejs.dev/blog/biome-wins-prettier-challenge/

# <twemoji-building-construction/> Frameworks etc.

## Qwik
<twemoji-globe-with-meridians/> https://qwik.builder.io/
With a new approach they (former Angular inventor) claim to have solved true instant apps. It eliminates the hydration-step, introducing something called "resumability". The code looks almost like React.
* 1.3.5 released this weekend - https://github.com/BuilderIO/qwik/releases/tag/v1.3.5
* Try the tutorial - https://qwik.builder.io/tutorial/welcome/overview/

## :has()

It's a CSS selector that allows you to select elements that contain a specific element as a child. Also known as the "parent selector". It's been in the works for a long time, and is somewhat of a CSS game changer.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:has

* It's now in every modern major browser.
* Just before Christmas it landed in Firefox:
  * https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/121.0/releasenotes/
  * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/121
* Bonus: it has lower specificity than many other selectors.
* Recommended 14-minute video (also covers **:where()** and **:is()**):

## :has() - basic example

<v-clicks>

```html
<section>Section 1 <aside>bonus content</aside></section>
<section>Section 2</section>
```

```css
section:has(aside) {
  color: red;
}
```

```js
// Result: Entire section saying "Section 1" turns red because it contains an aside.
```

<section style="color:red">Section 1 <aside>bonus content</aside></section>
<section>Section 2</section>

section:has(aside):has(h4) {
  color: red;
}
```

```css
/* Target sections containing either an aside, or h4, or both elements */
section:has(aside, h4) {
  color: red;
}
```

## :has() - advanced examples

<v-clicks>

Combine with other type of selectors to get even more powerful results.

```css
/* Target section's child-element "h4", if the section contains an aside */
section:has(aside) h4 {
  color: red;
}
```

```css
/* Target sections containing any type of direct child-elements if they're three or more */
section:has(> *:nth-child(3n)) {
  color: red;
}
```
