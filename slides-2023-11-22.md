## A11y framework

Gjensidige now has [an a11y framework and annotation kit](https://www.figma.com/file/X2B6wvS6Q6iSr3aiMVLNZe/A11y-Anotaion-kit--GJENSIDIGE?type=design&node-id=3-616&mode=design&t=O0GU4jakruTeMk09-0)! We have started opperationalizing the framework with teams, working our way through DD.

Like Form Patterns this is a start and we'll collaboratively grow the quality of our a11y work.
