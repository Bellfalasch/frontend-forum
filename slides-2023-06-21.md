* One breaking-branch
* New style of using them

```js

<ComponentX title="My title" description="My desc"/>

// New way - Compound Components
<ComponentX>
  <ComponentX.Title>My title</ComponentX.Title>
  <ComponentX.Description>My desc</ComponentX.Description>

# Common libraries

We all use them, and most of the time need them ... but:

```js
// Proxy components built in a shared library
import Title as OutTitle from Core
export const OurTitle(text) = return
(<Title text={cmsText(text)} />)

// In files used as such
<OurTitle text="Some.key"/>

// Future
import Title from Core
import MyCMS, MySanitize from LocalLibrary
<Title>
  <Text>
    <MySanitize><MyCMS>xxx</MyCMS></MySanitize>
    ...
```

# CSS patterns

* Specificity
* CSS for mobile first, collect ipad/desktop media queries in bottom of files?
* Order of declaration blocks? (a-z, purpose, box-modell, visual)
* Grouping? **margin: 0 0 1rem .3rem** versus **margin: 0; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-left: .3rem;**
