* Extending the CMS ("Custom Parts")

* Performance in real life (with Analytics/Tealium)

* Search - as a service?

* Testing, UU

* Personalization

* Chat, CallMe (Telia ACE)

* Custom Libraries - everyone do them on the side, mixed quality

# Five cent from the Front-end

<v-clicks>

* Define yourself - how do you want others to describe you

* Never stop communicating, ppl still need you to define yourself

* Proactively invite for collabs

* Do few things, really good

* Tech debt (yarn, lerna, storybook, webpack)

* Try more and stay on the happy path (web components, next.js, vite, esbuild)

* Don't jump all new trends, but don't stick forever with what works

* Focus on the most expected (textadmin?)

* Further improve docs

* application-portal

# Pitfalls

<v-clicks>

* Docs and culture is "Ferskvare"

* "Stagnated" tech (not trying new things)

* Do things you don't grow from

* Or do things in a way that's suboptimal

* Do too many things - the helpless helper

* Person-avhengighet

* Finishing tasks and move on

</v-clicks>
