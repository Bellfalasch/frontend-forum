# <twemoji-notebook-with-decorative-cover/> builders-components 1.8

_(Not the latest version, but the latest changelog posted in #builders-core - [See Storybook for all releasenotes](https://www.gjensidige.builders/docs/core/?path=/docs/packages-builders-components-release-notes--about) were they for the time being are auto-generated.)_

## Important from 1.8 onwards

> **Note:** Moving forward, both **ValidationMessage** and **HelpText** should be moved outside label elements for better accessibility. This is changed in all documentation, all components will add a console.warn about the change if used incorrectly, but the update is visually backwards compatible so you can do updates gradually


```js
// Recommended way of explicitly binding labels and helptexts to an input:
const uniqueId = 'MySuperUniqueID';
<Label htmlFor={uniqueId}>Label text</Label>
<HelpText htmlFor={uniqueId}>Help text</HelpText>
<Input id={uniqueId} />

// Stop using implicit binding using wrapping, example:
<Label>
  <HelpText/>
  <Input/>
</Label>
```

## Breaking changes

Vote using emojis, stick to one vote per person, comment in the thread.

* <twemoji-unicorn/> - We expect a perfect product that never changes
* <twemoji-stop-sign/> - Break 1-2 times a year, collect as much as possible for each break (= fewer but bigger breaks)
* <twemoji-warning/> - Break 4-6 times a year, collecting a few breaking changes and grouping them together so we don't need to change the code too often or much.
* <twemoji-green-heart/> - For all I care you could break stuff in every release, I handle stuff like that for breakfast, just let me know the details (edited)

## Breaking changes

### Conclusion?

* Break more often than not (most have no problems handling breaking changes)
* Clearly communicate breaking changes
* Upgrade/migration guides and scripts
* Releasing all new "mirror"-components, like with `<ComboBox>` was liked

## Release notes

* I prefer finding release notes collected for all releases in one place - for me that's Storybook (like today)
* I prefer finding release notes for all releases in one place - for me that's Github and the releases-section
* I would like to read a blog/article with release notes and some more information on gjensidige.builders
* Spawn a changelog.md (or similar) file with every package, I'll dig into it if needed
* Break down the release using beautiful emojis highlighting the updates in Slack (separate channel)
* Additional guides and more code examples on certain components, or upgrade jobs
* It would be nice with short videos on certain components, or upgrade jobs
* More information about the releases on Front-end Forum

## Release notes

### Conclusion?

* Users are loving the Slack-notes
* But collect them in a separate `announcement`-channel, for easier overview
* Some people would like release notes elsewhere, like Github, Storybook or changelog.md, but not many enough, but worth keeping in mind.
* Most likely zero worries with Builders dropping the auto-generated release-notes
* Some voices on "more guides", bigger pictures, not only one component using different props

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> Safari's webkit 17.5

Webkit is the rendering-engine used only by Safari. Here's some news in the less than two week old version.

* `text-wrap: balance` now works
    * makes a chunk of text balance its lines evenly (see article for examples)
    * expensive to use, so use with care, disabled on many lines in Firefox and Chrome
* `@starting-style {}` now works
    * give an element a starting style, useful for animations and transitions
* `light-dark()` now works
    * function for easier light-dark mode

```css
:root { --background: light-dark(#000, #fff); }
body { background: var(--background); } /* Dark-mode? Variable is now #000 */
```

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> Wake Lock API

A new API have landed in most browsers, it let's you control the screen from dimming og turning off while you run the app/website. This makes the web even more app-like.

* Landed in Chrome, Safari and Firefox
* Presentation web-apps, like Google Slides, can now stop screen from dimming
* Let web-apps that contain recepies not dim while you cook

```js
wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request(); // Request a wake lock
wakeLock.release(); // Return to normal when done
```

# Next FEF

## Will be held the **5th of June**

**Temporary location change**: Claims "stole" Samhandlingssonen, so I have booked two replacement rooms. Use any one of them, but perhaps the ones sitting closest to a room should go there, so we spread people:
* *Jenterommet* - Sales Private, Service Private, Service Commercial
* *Musikkrommet* - Builders & App, Sales Commercial, Claims  

Use the TV in the room to tune into the show using your Mac/PC, or call the meeting using the video room device. You'll figure it out =) I'll join one of the rooms physically.
