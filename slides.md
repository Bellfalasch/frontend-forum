## Breaking changes

Vote using emojis, stick to one vote per person, comment in the thread.

* <twemoji-unicorn/> - We expect a perfect product that never changes
* <twemoji-stop-sign/> - Break 1-2 times a year, collect as much as possible for each break (= fewer but bigger breaks)
* <twemoji-warning/> - Break 4-6 times a year, collecting a few breaking changes and grouping them together so we don't need to change the code too often or much.
* <twemoji-green-heart/> - For all I care you could break stuff in every release, I handle stuff like that for breakfast, just let me know the details (edited)

## Release notes

* I prefer finding release notes collected for all releases in one place - for me that's Storybook (like today)
* I prefer finding release notes for all releases in one place - for me that's Github and the releases-section
* I would like to read a blog/article with release notes and some more information on gjensidige.builders
* Spawn a changelog.md (or similar) file with every package, I'll dig into it if needed
* Break down the release using beautiful emojis highlighting the updates in Slack (like today, but in a separate channel)
* It would be nice with additional guides and more code examples on certain components, or upgrade jobs
* It would be nice with short videos on certain components, or upgrade jobs
* More information about the releases on Front-end Forum
