# Gjensidige for a front-ender

## Gjensidige

You probably know some of our history, operating countries, markets, etc.

But where are you in this mix?

# Technology & Insights

We just say "T&I", or "T, I", in normal conversations.

The director for T&I is **Sverre Johan Rostoft**. 

Digitalisation & Design is "our" area. Our director is **Kristian Vige**.

```mermaid

    TI(T&I)-->DD(Digitalisation & Design);

# Digitalisation & Design

We just say "DD" (D, D) in normal conversations.

The disciplinary leaders are a shared resource for all of DD.

You are a part of a team organized in one of these delivery areas:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    DD-->Builders++;
    DD-->Private;
    DD-->Commercial;
    DD-->Claims;
    DD-->Sweden;
    DD-->Devs(Developers*);
    DD-->Design(Designers*);
    DD-->Content(Content*);
```

\* Only contains employees, not consultants, for its corresponding disciplines. Each one "lended out" to a specific delivery team. A bit like our own in-house consultant agency.
