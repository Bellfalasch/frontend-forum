# <twemoji-wheelchair-symbol/> Accessibility

**WCAG 2.2** released a this autumn - https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ 

## A11y framework

Gjensidige and the design-community just kickstarted a new accessibility initiative, with the goal to make Gjensidige's digital services more accessible. The purpose is to raise general awarness on accessibility for everyone, and create a framework in Figma that designers can use to annotate for landmarks, roles, aria labels, and more.

Presentation and more info - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMil89dM=/

This was launched for employees, but will be spread to consultants. **WCAG 2.0** is a legal requirement for all public services in Norway, and it's the minimal spec each FE-developer must follow ([even includes old apps](https://www.uutilsynet.no/regelverk/gjeldende-regelverk-og-krav/746)).

Some details we've collected: https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/universal-design/code

### Github inspo

Many teams still live in the Jira-world (and Confluence), for many reasons, but here's an inspirational use of Github wiki from Team Builders: https://github.com/gjensidige/builders-platform/wiki/How-we-label-pull-requests
