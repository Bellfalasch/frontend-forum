## Inklud is coming

April - June we'll hire an expert a11y advisor here in Oslo.

One full day, once a week, one team per slot, cross-disciplinary.

Many (but not all) teams are now scheduled.

## Accessibility Champions

Most Oslo-teams now have champions, for Front-end and UX respectively. 

Plan for Denmark, Sweden and Bratislava is under construction.

This is an added role. Each with this role will meet at regular intervals, and share experiences and learnings.

They are not experts on a11y, neither am I, but with one single person per team to communicate, it will be easier to get moving. If they need help, it will be easier to assist.
