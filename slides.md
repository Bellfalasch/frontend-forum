## Inklud is coming

April - June we'll hire an expert a11y advisor here in Oslo.

One full day each week, one team per slot, cross-disciplinary.

Many (but not all) teams are now scheduled.

Consultants should talk to their mother company (Itera, Capra, etc) if they feel they need upskilling in this area.

## Accessibility Champions

Most Oslo-teams now have these for Front-end and UX respectively. 

Plan for Denmark, Sweden and Bratislava is under construction.

This is an added role. Each with this role will meet at regular intervals, and share experiences and learnings.

They are not experts on a11y, neither am I, but with one single person per team to communicate, it will be easier to get the message across. If they need help, it will be easier to assist.

## Basic tips & tricks

* Do **not** underestimate the power of pure HTML
  * [Welcome to HTML at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/welcome?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%2Fwelcome)
  * [Semantic HTML at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%2Fsemantic-html)
* The core building blocks of any website carries a lot of native features that are a11y-friendly
* [Learn Accessibility at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility)
* See bullets from last FEF

## Handy tool

A more approachable checklist I like is this:
* https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/

Perhaps not the easiest documents to digest:
* https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/
* https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/
