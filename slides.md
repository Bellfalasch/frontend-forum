## Expert advisor

Inklud, experts on accessibility in Norway, is here today! Joining Team Builders the entire day.

They'll return one day each week until end of June, to support our teams in Oslo.

The expert will do a lot of hands-on testing using screen readers, keyboard navigation and other tools. As well as discussing WCAG rules and active laws.

The goal is to strengthen our a11y *confidence*, and make our products more accessible in the process.

## Accessibility Champions

All Oslo-teams now have champions, one for Front-end and one for UX respectively. 

We also have these in Denmark and Sweden, while we haven't worked out details for the Polish or Slovakian staff yet.

Champions are not experts, but the go-to person for each team to focus on a11y and elevate questions in the bi-weekly Accessibility Champions forum. Here they share experiences and learnings, as well as discuss shared topics and issues.
