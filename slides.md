# Looking forward - 2025

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Chapter Leads

We will begin to see the true power of "embedded" CLs in all tribes.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Tech debt

Hopefully more teams will rise out of the tech-debt ashes, either by upgrades or building new things. More will enjoy the benefits of the modern `builders-core`

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Designsystem

`builders-components` will release at least one breaking change in 2025, mainly cleaning up deprecated components making the codebase smaller and faster.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Upgrades

React 19, Vite 6, and other modern techs - many Gjensidige teams will begin looking at upgrading. There will most likely not be a React 20 this year, making this a good year to catch up.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Vanilla

More teams will begin using vanilla CSS as it keeps maturing, less packages and pre-processors. Browser support will increase for feature we've been drooling over in 2024. Less and Sass will not be as common by the end of the year. We might even see the devs behind Less announcing end-of-life. We'll see a first web component in production.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Server-side

Doing stuff server-side - It was cool in 1999, and it is now cool again. Teams that adopt React 19 will be able to do slow and heavy things a lot faster server-side, a step that will take time to implement, but speed up their apps.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Bun, deno, turborepo

More Gjensidige-teams see the insane value of modern tools (often Rust-based). More repoes will do bun (or deno).

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# New ways of linting

The oxc linter Oxlint will release a stable version and now teams will have many options to move away from the slow prettier+eslint spaghetti.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Toolchain chaos

As Rust have entered the playing field for real, many of your tried and tested packages and tools will lose to new Rust-tools. Some Rust-tools of today will even be replaced by other, even faster tools, by the end of the year. The ones that appeared in 2024 will mature a lot in 2025. It will be a somewhat chaotic 2025.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# WCAG 3

There will be serious movements and progress on WCAG 3. No release in 2025, but expect a lot of progress and news on it during global accessibility awerness day (May 15).

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Team Evan You

Major breakthroughs on Vite, building and bundling will change how we stack in 2025. Not only will we have stable versions of the entire toolchain, but Vite 7 will be a major lift, replacing it's entire build-stack. This will have big ripple effects on the community.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# AI you can't resist

Even the most skeptical developer will give in and begin using AI as the features, speed, and the quality it gives keeps increasing by the day. We can generate entire projects, auto-complete directly from `builders-components`, integrate with Jira-issues, writing tests automatically while we write functions, and more. How we do daily work by the end of 2025 will not look like we do today.
