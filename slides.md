# <twemoji-wheelchair-symbol/> Accessibility-docs!

<v-clicks depth="2">

* Just before the summer we went live with our first take on an a11y-doc
  * (I've been asked to explain that a11y is short for accessibility, "a + 11 characters + y")
* Hoping to get some feedback, help with missing parts
* Contains an intro from Builders, WCAG-overview, help with testing, front-end code cheat sheet.

# Clever things / worth mentioning

## Smaller Faro tracing

### Henrik Lillengen

If anyone want tracing in grafana, but dont want to pull down the huge @grafana/faro-web-tracing -lib (think it increases our bundle size with about 7% in a already huge app), i have an example implementation here where i'm doing tracing manually: https://github.com/gjensidige/salg-core/pull/365/files

# Clever things / worth mentioning

## Unified Session ID

### Sigurd Falk

About `session_id` on our web portals <twemoji-thinking-face/>

Today, several apps are generating a Session ID when a user is navigating around on our web portals. Fex:

* [Sales online shop](https://github.com/gjensidige/salg-nettbutikk/blob/main/src/shared/utils/sessionUtils.ts)  
* [@service -libs](https://github.com/gjensidige/service/blob/main/packages/client-identification/src/index.ts#L22)  
* Open Pages: Uses the Grafana Faro native one

This makes it hard to track user journeys across our apps and across Open- and Logged In pages.

Would it make sense to have a common way to generate session_id ? A very simple (and not at all thought through) approach could be to agree on a common place to store this ID and a common name for it everyone uses. The each app could just check if the ID exists from being generated by another app and if not generate a new one to use.

Fex: **Session ID should always be stored in the browser Session Storage with key name `session_id` and value format "8 digits hash"**

Thought about this?

# Clever things / worth mentioning

## Updated Front-end-pages

[Our front-end pages](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/frontend) have been updated!

* More relevant links and information on the [landing page](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/frontend), and in the main navigation.
* [Principles for building web applications](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/principles) (new order, new items - now 26 in total, improved texts)
* Added some "candidate principles" to said page, things we're considering. What's your input?
* Rewrote the page [Supported browsers](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/supported-browsers) to assist you a bit better, while also giving some sane pointers.
* Created a brand new page dedicated to [automated testing](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/testing-principles) at Gjensidige, since this has been asked about for a while. With this being a new page, we're eager to hear your feedback.
* Updated the [universal design for developers](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/universal-design/code) page, refreshing some tips, and pointing readers to the brand new [accessibility guidelines in Storybook](https://www.gjensidige.builders/docs/core/?path=/docs/accessibility-introduction--about) instead.

All changes are based on discussions, questions, comments, and requests, made by *you* - the community.

# Community poll

## Feature Toggling

Are you using (or used to use) feature toggling in your web applications?

* <twemoji-keycap-1/> I am currently using it at Gjensidige - using external tools, our something we built ourselves
* <twemoji-keycap-2/> I did in previous jobs, loved it, would use again but are not using it here today
* <twemoji-keycap-3/> I did in previous jobs, didn't love it and won't use here
* <twemoji-keycap-4/> I would love to use it, but have no experience with it
* <twemoji-keycap-5/> Isch, a bit of A/B-testing here and there, but could probably do more if we had tools
* <twemoji-keycap-6/> I know what it is but see no point in using it, we ship fast :boat:
* <twemoji-keycap-0/> What is feature toggling?

_Gjensidige currently have no official tooling or policy for this, but depending on needs and wants with the teams we can investigate further._

# Feature Toggling

So, some context ...

Many years ago, a few persons wanted to explore FT, and created a proof of concept by buying one license for Unleash. These persons quit, but the admin-user remained. Teams found it, heard about it, or read about it in confluence.

We now have many users, and teams, using this, without it ever being intended for more than a one-user PoC.

Hence, we must see the true need and do a proper evaluation, and then properly buy it, with giving it an owner, a budget, and so on. Software must be owned at Gjensidige, like GitHub is owned by Team Platform.

## Release notes

### Conclusion?

* Users are loving the Slack-notes
* But collect them in a separate `announcement`-channel, for easier overview
* Some people would like release notes elsewhere, like Github, Storybook or changelog.md, but not many enough, but worth keeping in mind.
* Most likely zero worries with Builders dropping the auto-generated release-notes
* Some voices on "more guides", bigger pictures, not only one component using different props

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> CSS5

## Let's talk about CSS5

CSS3 came ... in 2009! It has since grown a lot. But with this liquid version, it is hard to know if you are doing CSS3 anno 2009 or CSS3 anno 2024, which are vastly different.

Big tech-voices are starting to ask for a new CSS-version, and they want to jump directly to 5.
