# Accessibility

**WCAG 2.2** released a month ago - https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ 

## A11y framework

Gjensidige and the design-community just kickstarted a new accessibility initiative, with the goal to make Gjensidige's digital services more accessible. The purpose is to raise general awarness on UU for everyone, and prepare a framework in Figma that designers can use to annotate for UU landmarks, roles, aria labels, and more.

## Node 20 is now LTS

Node 18 is no longer LTS (Long Term Support), but 20.9.0 is promoted to this instead.

Node 20 will be supported until April 2026 under the LTS program. LTS releases receive bug fixes and security updates for 30 months from release and are ready for general use. Big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Netflix are using Node.js LTS releases in production.

Next FEF was planned for **25th of October**, but this crashes with *Digitalisering og Design* two-day gathering.

<twemoji-crying-face/> No FEF **25th of October**
