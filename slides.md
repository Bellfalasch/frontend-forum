## A11y-responsibles

**Accessibility Champions** are now in Oslo teams. 

This group will themself decide how to improve a11y in their teams, and will be the go-to-person for a11y in their team.

They are not experts on a11y, neither am I, but with one single person per team to communicate, it will be easier to get the message across. If they need help, it will be easier to assist. And what they learn, and what they need advice on, the group can benefit.
