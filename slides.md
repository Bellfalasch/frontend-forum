# Looking forward - 2025

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Chapter Leads

We will begin to see the true power of "embedded" CLs in all tribes.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Tech debt

Hopefully more teams will rise out of the tech-debt ashes, either by upgrades or building new things. More will enjoy the benefits of `builders-core`

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Designsystem

`builders-components` will not release any breaking changes in 2025, it will remain on 1.x

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Upgrades

React 19, Vite 6, and other modern techs - many Gjensidige teams will begin looking at upgrading. There will most likely not be a React 20 this year.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Vanilla

More teams will begin using vanilla CSS as it keeps maturing, less packages and pseduopre-processors. Browser support will increase for feature we've been drooling over in 2024. Less and Sass will not be as common by the end of the year.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Server-side

Doing stuff server-side - It was cool in 1999, and it is now cool again. Teams that adopt React 19 will be able to do slow and heavy things a lot faster server-side, a step that will take time to implement, but speed up their apps.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Bun, biome, deno, turborepo

More Gjensidige-teams see the insane value of modern tools (often Rust-based). More repoes will do bun (or deno).

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Toolchain chaos

As Rust enters the playing field for real, many of your tried and tested packages and tools will lose to new Rust-tools. Some will be replaced by other, even faster tools. The ones that appeared in 2024 will mature in 2025, and new ones will be introduced. It will be a somewhat chaotic 2025.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Oxlint

The linter will release a stable version and most users will never use **eslint** and **prettier** again

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# WCAG 3

There will be serious movements and progress on WCAG 3. No release in 2025, but except a lot of progress and news on it during global accessibility awerness day (May 15).

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# Team Evan You

Major breakthroughs on Vite, building and bundling will change how we stack in 2025. Not only will we have stable versions of the entire toolchain, but Vite 7 will be a major lift, replacing it's entire stack. This will have big ripple effects on the community.

---
transition: slide-up
layout: future
---

# AI you can't resist

Even the most skeptical developer will give in and begin using AI as the features, speed, and the quality it gives keeps increasing by the day. We can generate entire projects, auto-complete directly from `builders-components`, integrate with Jira-issues, writing tests automatically while we write functions, and more. How we do daily work by the end of 2025 will not look like we do today.
