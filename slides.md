# <twemoji-headstone/> Sunsetted libraries

* **Grid** - what are people planning? Builders are considering smaller util components.
* **ESlint** - try defaults, create your own overwrites per repo or shared (usually pretty small).
* **Global CSS** - killed
* **Utils** - killed (use tokens instead)
* **Link Helper** - killed (used only locally)

# <twemoji-ballot-box-with-ballot/> FE Survey

Gjensidige have done an amazing journey the last few years. From introducing **Slack** and **Github**, to **GAP** and **Builders Core**, to all the applications each one of you develop.

We're now interesting in understanding more about your experience as a *front-end developer*.

* What tools do you use,
* tools you cannot use,
* gaps in the practical day-to-day development,
* other pain-points,
* things that make you happy.

What could the community, the discipline, and Gjensidige do better?
