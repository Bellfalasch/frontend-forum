# Github inspo

Many teams still live in the Jira-world (and Confluence), for many reasons, but here's an inspirational use of Github wiki from Team Builders:

# <twemoji-wheelchair-symbol/> Accessibility

**WCAG 2.2** released a month ago - https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ 

## A11y framework

Gjensidige and the design-community just kickstarted a new accessibility initiative, with the goal to make Gjensidige's digital services more accessible. The purpose is to raise general awarness on accessibility for everyone, and create a framework in Figma that designers can use to annotate for landmarks, roles, aria labels, and more.

Presentation and more info - https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVMil89dM=/

This was launched for employees, but will be spread to consultants. **WCAG 2.0** is a legal requirement for all public services in Norway, and it's the minimal spec each FE-developer must follow ([even includes old apps](https://www.uutilsynet.no/regelverk/gjeldende-regelverk-og-krav/746)).

Some details we've collected: https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/universal-design/code

# <twemoji-keyboard/> Github Copilot

Team Platform is leading a pilot on [Github copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). A few invited employees are testing it out, and will report back on their experience, I'm one of them.

Goal is to see the benefits, the cost, how it's used, and then investigate if this is something to be rolled out to all developers or not.

## Node 20 is now LTS

Node 20 (**20.9.0**) is now promoted to LTS (Long Term Support)!

Node 20 will be supported until **April 2026** under the LTS program. LTS releases receive bug fixes and security updates for 30 months from release and are ready for general use. Big companies like Google, Microsoft, and Netflix are using Node.js LTS releases in production.

https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/main/doc/changelogs/CHANGELOG_V20.md#20.9.0

## Node 21 is out

When a Node-version is promoted to LTS, a new version is also created. 17 October we saw the release of Node 21.
