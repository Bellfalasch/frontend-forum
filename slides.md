# Builders Core

Huge improvements, and new way of using them - **Compound Components**

```js
// Old way
<ComponentX title="My title" description="My desc"/>

// New way
<ComponentX>
  <ComponentX.Title>My title</ComponentX.Title>
  <ComponentX.Description>My desc</ComponentX.Description>
</ComponentX>
```

# <twemoji-headstone/> Sunsetted libraries

* <twemoji-coffin /> **Grid** - what are people planning? Builders are considering smaller util components.
* <twemoji-coffin /> **ESlint** - try defaults, create your own overwrites per repo or shared (usually pretty small).
* <twemoji-coffin /> **Global CSS** - it was just getting in the way
* <twemoji-coffin /> **Utils** - use tokens and CSS instead
* <twemoji-coffin /> **Link Helper** - used only locally

# <twemoji-ballot-box-with-ballot/> FE Survey

Gjensidige have done an amazing journey the last few years. From introducing **Slack** and **Github**, to **GAP** and **Builders Core**, to all the applications each one of you develop.

We're now interesting in understanding more about your experience as a *front-end developer*.

* What tools do you use,
* tools you cannot use,
* gaps in the practical day-to-day development,
* other pain-points,
* things that make you happy.

What could the community, the discipline, and Gjensidige do better?
