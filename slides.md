# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> WCAG 3.0

**Global Accessibility Awarness day** was the **16th of May**, **W3C** celebrated this by publishing their **latest draft** on **WCAG 3.0**.

* Early early stages
* Worked on by W3C
* Details the unspoken information, like tone of voice etc
* Based on 174 "outcomes", moving away from the established "success criterias"
* This is up from translatable 78 found in WCAG 2.1 (A, AA and AAA)
* Focuses on "what did we miss in WCAG 2.x?"

# <twemoji-cherry-blossom/> Curious on CSS layers?

Two weeks ago on **Smashing Magazine**, inspiring article on "do you really need that framework for that design", covering basically how powerful CSS have become as of late.

Not everything is ready for production, but if you wanna sneak peek into the CSS future using layers, have a read!

Many will, by old habits, boilerplate a new project using some standard packages and frameworks. CSS wanna eliminate the need for a lot of them.
