# Smaller tracing

## Henrik Lillengen

If anyone want tracing in grafana, but dont want to pull down the huge @grafana/faro-web-tracing -lib (think it increases our bundle size with about 7% in a already huge app), i have an example implementation here where i'm doing tracing manually: https://github.com/gjensidige/salg-core/pull/365/files

# Unified Session ID

## Sigurd Falk

About session_id on our web portals :thinking_face:
Today, several apps are generating a Session ID when a user is navigating around on our web portals. Fex:
Sales online shop: https://github.com/gjensidige/salg-nettbutikk/blob/main/src/shared/utils/sessionUtils.ts
@service -libs: https://github.com/gjensidige/service/blob/main/packages/client-identification/src/index.ts#L22
Open Pages: Uses the Grafana Faro native one
This makes it hard to track user journeys across our apps and across Open- and Logged In pages.
Would it make sense to have a common way to generate session_id ? A very simple (and not at all thought through) approach could be to agree on a common place to store this ID and a common name for it everyone uses. The each app could just check if the ID exists from being generated by another app and if not generate a new one to use.
Fex:
Session ID should always be stored in the browser Session Storage with key name session_id and value format "8 digits hash"
Thought about this?

:sunglasses: [Our front-end pages](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/frontend) have been updated!

* :compass: More relevant links and information on the [landing page](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/frontend), and in the main navigation.
* :books: Restructured and expanded the [Principles for building web applications](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/principles) (new order, new items - now 26 in total, improved texts)
* :student: Added some "candidate principles" to said page. These are principles we're considering. What's your input?
* :computer: Rewrote the entire [Supported browsers](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/supported-browsers) page to assist you a bit better, while also giving some sane pointers.
* :test_tube: Created a brand new page dedicated to [automated testing](https://www.gjensidige.builders/community/blog/testing-principles) at Gjensidige, since this has been asked about for a while. With this being a new page, we're eager to hear your feedback.
* :wheelchair: Updated the [universal design for developers](https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/universal-design/code) page, refreshing some tips, and pointing readers to the brand new [accessibility guidelines in Storybook](https://www.gjensidige.builders/docs/core/?path=/docs/accessibility-introduction--about) instead.

All changes are based on discussions, questions, comments, and requests, made by *you* - the community - over time.

:palm_tree: :desert_island: Enjoy the rest of the summer! :sunny:

## Feature Toggling

Are you using (or used to use) feature toggling in your web applications?

* :one: I am currently using it at :gjensidige: - using external tools, our something we built ourselves
* :two: I did in previous jobs, loved it, would use again but are not using it here today
* :three: I did in previous jobs, didn't love it and won't use here
* :four: I would love to use it, but have no experience with it
* :five: Isch, a bit of A/B-testing here and there, but could probably do more if we had tools
* :six: I know what it is but see no point in using it, we ship fast :boat:
* :zero: What is feature toggling?

_Gjensidige currently have no official tooling or policy for this, but depending on needs and wants with the teams we can investigate further._

## Release notes

### Conclusion?

* Users are loving the Slack-notes
* But collect them in a separate `announcement`-channel, for easier overview
* Some people would like release notes elsewhere, like Github, Storybook or changelog.md, but not many enough, but worth keeping in mind.
* Most likely zero worries with Builders dropping the auto-generated release-notes
* Some voices on "more guides", bigger pictures, not only one component using different props

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> CSS5

## Let's talk about CSS5

CSS3 came ... in 2009! It has since grown a lot. But with this liquid version, it is hard to know if you are doing CSS3 anno 2009 or CSS3 anno 2024, which are vastly different.

Big tech-voices are starting to ask for a new CSS-version, and they want to jump directly to 5.
