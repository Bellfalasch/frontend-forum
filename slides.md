# Accessibility

**WCAG 2.2** released a month ago - https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/ 

## A11y framework

Gjensidige and the design-community just kickstarted a new accessibility initiative, with the goal to make Gjensidige's digital services more accessible. The purpose is to raise general awarness on UU for everyone, and prepare a framework in Figma that designers can use to annotate for UU landmarks, roles, aria labels, and more.

# Github Copilot

Team Platform is leading a pilot on Github copilot. A few invited employees are testing it out, and will report back on their experience, I'm one of them.

Goal is to see the benefits, the cost, and then investigate if this is something to be rolled out to all developers.
