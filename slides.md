## Inklud is coming

April - June we'll hire an expert a11y advisor here in Oslo.

One full day, once a week, one team per slot, cross-disciplinary.

Many (but not all) teams are now scheduled.

Consultants should talk to their mother company (Itera, Capra, etc) if they feel they need upskilling in this area.

## Accessibility Champions

Most Oslo-teams now have champions, for Front-end and UX respectively. 

Plan for Denmark, Sweden and Bratislava is under construction.

This is an added role. Each with this role will meet at regular intervals, and share experiences and learnings.

They are not experts on a11y, neither am I, but with one single person per team to communicate, it will be easier to get moving. If they need help, it will be easier to assist.

## Basic tips & tricks

* Do **not** underestimate the power of pure HTML
  * [Welcome to HTML at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/welcome?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%2Fwelcome)
  * [Semantic HTML at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/html/semantic-html?continue=https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%23article-https%3A%2F%2Fweb.dev%2Flearn%2Fhtml%2Fsemantic-html)
* The core building blocks of any website carries a lot of native features that are a11y-friendly
* [Learn Accessibility at web.dev](https://web.dev/learn/accessibility)
* Beware: just because it just landed in Chrome, it might not behave as expected in assistive tools yet.
* See bullets from last FEF

## Handy tool

A more approachable checklist I like is this:
* https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/

Perhaps not the easiest documents to digest:
* https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/
* https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/

With so many new features, perhaps something can be spring-cleaned away in your custom components?

* `<Loader variant="spinner">` can now cycle messages based on elapsed milliseconds
* `<Numberpicker>` is here

Take a dive!

## Resources

Thorstein in Team Builders posted this nice guide.

Excellent, detailed, and easy on the eyes, guides for getting into web development.

Still relevant for many of us, especially if you're more of an React-expert than a vanilla-expert.
