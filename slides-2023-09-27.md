# Builders Core

For details, see Slack: *#builders-core*

Keep the feedback flowing! <twemoji-red-heart />

Ask questions, come with constructive feedback (or even a PR!).

~~One~~ Two releases since last FEF (Builders now move around and visits teams in Oslo to help, and learn).

# <twemoji-building-construction/> Flex

Builders are working on a new generation Grid-replacer, currently named **Flex**.

The code was merged into `main` of Builders Core yesterday evening.

It is *experimental*, so if you use it:

* Be prepared for sudden breaking changes
* Try it in a limited/controlled way
* Give Builders feedback on it!

---

# <twemoji-building-construction/> FileUploader

Builders just started designing a new **FileUploader**.

Do you use it? We would like your input! Design-phase is nearing a critical point.

---

---

# <twemoji-headstone/> Node 16

Worth repeating, but **Node 16** is now officially **dead** <twemoji-face-with-crossed-out-eyes/>

Make sure to let your PO/TL know about this, and upgrade to Node 18/20.

---
transition: slide-up
---

# <twemoji-headstone/> Github and Node 16

Github recently announced that within 6 months, they will no longer support **Node 16** for those that *build* Github Actions. They need to upgrade to Node 20.

https://github.blog/changelog/2023-09-22-github-actions-transitioning-from-node-16-to-node-20/

What this means for you? Basically look for updates to your actions and upgrade when available.

# <twemoji-chart-increasing-with-yen/> Tech-Debt

Topic to get more focus further. Using our forum to spread more knowledge.

<v-clicks>

* Debt is **0** on brand new projects (usually)
* It uses new best practices for building, new libraries, etc
* Upgrades done during project
* But after release?
* Stuck on old CRA, Webpack 3/4, or Node 14/16, or React 16/17
* Debt is accumulated over time
* Adding new packages is troublesome (like Builders Core)
* However, some apps doesn't need upgrades
* "Quickfix" might sometime be to just change to Vite?

# <twemoji-newspaper/> Builders website

Front-end "hub" on Gjensidige Builders website has changed URL.

We're now under */learn/*

https://www.gjensidige.builders/learn/frontend

PS! Recommended reading: https://www.gjensidige.builders/blog/conversational-form-design

# Accessibility

Use proper HTML element rather than aria-tagging.

https://web.dev/learn/accessibility/aria-html/#rule-1-dont-use-aria

* `button` for things that acts like buttons, not `span` with `aria-role="button"`

* `nav` for menus, not `div` with `aria-role="menu"`

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/menu_role

Also check more in-depth https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/ like how elements should interact with keyboard, and Aria-roles.

PS. There's 142 HTML-elements! <twemoji-exploding-head/>

# <twemoji-rolled-up-newspaper/> FE News

## Bun 1.0.3

Bun's been out for two weeks. 3 fix-releases since then.

https://bun.sh/

Many users love the speed, but report multiple issues with migrating complex apps, not mature enough, slow in too many scenarios, compatibility issues, etc. User "strager" got 100k views on [his video migrating an existing app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVMMoDWN79E), titled "Don't use Bun".

## Monorepo

Pretty excellent and easy to browse explanation on Mono versus Poly.

https://monorepo.tools/

Nice for sharing with non-techies (short sentences, illustrations, summaries).

Nice overview and comparison on all needs, tools, and whatnots, for monorepos.
